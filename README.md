## 📄 Project Description

Showz, a ticket‑sales company, has engaged a data analytics intern to optimize its marketing spend. This analysis uses:

- **Web server logs** covering site visits from January 2017 through December 2018  
- **Order records** for all ticket purchases during the same period  
- **Marketing spend data** by channel and month  

The objectives of this project are to:

1. **Characterize** how users engage with the Showz platform.  
2. **Identify** when new visitors convert to paying customers.  
3. **Quantify** the lifetime value (LTV) contributed by each customer.  
4. **Determine** the payback period: when cumulative revenue covers customer acquisition cost (CAC).
